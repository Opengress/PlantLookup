# Plant Lookup
Look up NZ plant names - by name!

## About
Plant Lookup is an imaginatively named Android application which allows you to query names of plants in New Zealand. The software itself is Licensed under GPL3 and you can get it [for sideloading](https://chris-nz.com/plantlookup/). Basically, you are shown a list of all known names for plants, and you start typing what you're thinking to narrow the scope of the list. You can quickly scroll to the name you're thinking of and click it to see alternative names! **Really, the important thing about this application is that it works offline.**

## Plant Names
Uses plant names database from [Landcare Research](https://nvs.landcareresearch.co.nz/Content/CurrentNVSNames.csv). This database will be downloaded and processed when the app is first run.

## No Play Store?
Maybe this will be back on Play Store at a later date.
Recent changes in Play Store policy have created real problems for privacy and security,
and I don't think that consumers like you and I can safely use it the way we used to.

## Licence
GPL3.
