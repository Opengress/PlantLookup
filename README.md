= Plant Lookup =
Look up NZ plant names - by name!

== About ==
Plant Lookup is an imaginatively named Android application which allows you to query names of plants in New Zealand. The software itself is Licensed under GPL3 and you can get it [for sideloading] (https://chris-nz.com/plantlookup/app-release.apk) or on [Play Store] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.opengress.plantlookup). Basically, you are shown a list of all known names for plants, and you start typing what you're thinking to narrow the scope of the list. You can quickly scroll to the name you're thinking of and click it to see alternative names! **Really, the important thing about this application is that it works offline.**

== Plant Names ==
Uses plant names database from [Landcare Research] (https://nvs.landcareresearch.co.nz/Content/CurrentNVSNames.csv). This database will be downloaded and processed when the app is first run.

== Licence ==
I will add a file specifically for this. For now, understand that the package and the code within it are available under terms of what is commonly known as GPL3.
